## Vulnerability Disclosure
If you think you have found a potential security vulnerability in
requests, please email [us](mailto:34110430+giulio-coa@users.noreply.github.com) directly.
**Do not file a public issue.**

If English is not your first language, please try to describe the
problem and its impact to the best of your ability. For greater detail,
please use your native language and we will try our best to translate it
using online services.

Please also include the code you used to find the problem and the
shortest amount of code necessary to reproduce it.

Please do not disclose this to anyone else.

We will respect your privacy and will only publicize your involvement if
you grant us permission.

### Process
This following information discusses the process the requests project
follows in response to vulnerability disclosures. If you are disclosing
a vulnerability, this section of the documentation lets you know how we
will respond to your disclosure.

#### Timeline
When you report an issue, one of the project members will respond to you
as soon as possible. This initial response will at the very
least confirm receipt of the report.

If we were able to rapidly reproduce the issue, the initial response
will also contain confirmation of the issue. If we are not, we will
often ask for more information about the reproduction scenario.

Our goal is to have a fix for any vulnerability released as soon as possible
of the initial disclosure.

Once the fix is prepared, we will notify you that we
believe we have a fix. Often we will ask you to confirm the fix resolves
the problem in your environment, especially if we are not confident of
our reproduction scenario.

At this point, we will prepare for the release.
We will also decide on a planned release date, and let you
know when it is. This release date will *always* be on a weekday.

On release day, we will push the patch to our public repository, along
with an updated changelog that describes the issue and credits you.
